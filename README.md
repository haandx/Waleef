## what is waleef ?
Waleef application facilitates and improves the experience of the elderly with technology through the use of text classification & speech classification and an analysis of the Arabic language, especially the local dialects, to facilitate the access of the elderly to various services

### The problem: 
The elderly face difficulty adapting to the accelerated digital transformation, while we can employ technology to serve them

1. The elderly can request health care and book appointments by writing the request and symptoms and making suggestions for them and booking appointments. The health condition can be predicted based on the written symptoms + reading medical prescriptions
2. Access to delivery services and request needs
3. A smart map that responds to the request of places such as the mosque, hospital, etc., and provides the easiest route
4. Reminder of medication appointments + drinking water + prayers, etc 
5. Easily book appointments with government and care services
6. Reading texts or images that contain text (the user can scan text and convert it to read)
7. Ease of access to technical services such as Absher, Tawakkolna, and others
